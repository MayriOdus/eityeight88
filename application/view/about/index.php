		<p>
		EITY EIGHT took the first step in the business as an importer of well-known makeup and skincare brands from South Korea to launch in Thai market. EITY EIGHT has later become an official manufacturer and introduced our first product in 2015 with the following business transaction ideas:</p>
		
		<h5>Knowledge and Competency:</h5>

		<p>
		Many years of experience in association with Korean cosmetic firms, we have gained specialties in quality and efficiency in initiating new products, especially for girls and women in Asia to own a deluxe beauty.  </p> 
		<h5>Caring:</h5>

		<p>
		In each detail of each stage of the production, we put our greatest effort in because we truly know what the natures of Asian skins are like. We introduce the best goods to match your skin types in order that you can enjoy applying skin cares and makeups on your sensitive skin unhesitatingly.</p>

		<h5>Convenience:</h5>

		<p>
		Our qualified products are either manufactured within or imported to Thailand to facilitate you so that travelling all the way to Korea for beauty shopping will no longer be necessary, but just a grasp away here in Thailand.</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>EITY EIGHT</strong> dreams of your beauty transformation with confidence!
